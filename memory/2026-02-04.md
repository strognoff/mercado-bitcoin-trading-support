- Had initial setup conversation: user confirmed I am Nova, their calm AI assistant, and told me to use `avatars/nova-pixel.png` as my avatar.
- Work in this session so far has focused on reading the workspace, updating identity/user metadata, and tidying bootstrap files.
- Tried to open X via the browser tool; the Chrome extension relay tab couldn’t be snapshotted (gateway reported “tab not found”) and the openclaw-managed profile refuses to launch because the configured Brave path doesn’t exist. I also do not have X credentials stored, so please log in/attach the extension when ready before I try again.
- After you pointed out the credentials already exist, I located them at `~/.config/x/credentials.json`. I’m ready to use them once the browser control surface is connected to an X tab.
- Tried opening X/home to test again, but the Chrome relay still reports “tab not found”, confirming that the extension isn’t attached to that tab yet. Once the Relay icon shows “ON”, I can start posting.
- Thanks for reattaching: the Relay is now on and I can see the home timeline plus trending topics again.
- Ran a live test just now. I posted: “Morning check: @Reuters says Novo Nordisk warning is rattling markets while @SkyNews notes today’s Xi-Putin call. Politics tags Labour Party / Mossad / Lammy / Hague are trending in the UK. Sharing this to keep tabs on the pulse.” That confirms I can log in, read the feed, and post when needed.

- Logged manual trading workflow request: 4H BTC swing plan, decision to analyze chart, and agreed to run trading-support plan command with target entry ~73,180 USD, stop near 71,800 USD, and 4H exit logic notes.
