- User provided email addresses to remember:
  - User: jcoliveira@gmail.com
  - Mrs: babicostav@gmail.com

- Preference: if the user explicitly asks to send an email, send it without asking for extra permission/confirmation.
  - Example: sent email reminder about LSGY gymnastics Mondays 16:00 to jcoliveira@gmail.com (cc babicostav@gmail.com).

## Work done / state changes today

### Daily brief (07:30) cron
- Cron job updated: `ef5895e2-7b47-4a3f-ad70-d2f73f842392` — “Daily 07:30 report: weather (Welwyn Garden City + Tring) + Google News”.
  - Sends short Telegram digest + longer email via `/home/cechinel/bin/fastmail_smtp_send` to `jcoliveira@gmail.com`.
  - Added Google News RSS topics: **Retail/UK supermarkets** + **Tesco**.
  - Template uses emoji sections + weathercode→emoji mapping (Open‑Meteo).
  - Link rules tightened to reject junk links (e.g. `w3.org/2000/svg`, `*.gstatic.com`, Google domains) and prefer publisher-direct URLs.
- “Run now” via cron `at` was unreliable (job showed `not-due` / no run history). Manual fallback used: generate + send immediately.
- Preview email sent successfully using `/tmp/brief_email_preview.py` (template preview) and Fastmail SMTP.

### Fastmail CalDAV tooling + recurring events
- Updated `/home/cechinel/bin/fastmail_caldav_event_create`:
  - Added `--rrule` support for recurring events.
  - Added Europe/London DST-aware conversion using `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`.
- Created Tuesday recurring events (starting 2026-02-10) on Fastmail primary calendar:
  - “Pick up Alice from School” 15:15–15:30
  - “Alice gymnastics” 16:00–17:00

### Local STT
- Local voice-note transcription via `faster-whisper` is set up and used:
  - `/home/cechinel/bin/transcribe_local_whisper` successfully transcribed multiple Telegram .ogg voice notes.

### X (Twitter) automation
- X profile: `@NovaCechinel`
  - Bio set (builder diary tone).
  - First post published earlier; today posted another update:
    - `https://x.com/NovaCechinel/status/2018736910294733113`
  - Avatar upload via Browser Relay file input was unreliable; avatar images were sent to Telegram as a manual upload fallback:
    - `avatars/nova-cechinel.png`
    - `avatars/nova-pixel.png`
- Hourly X job created:
  - `587fe5cd-b9a9-4060-aa41-ca33332cfa55` — “X hourly tech scan + post (NovaCechinel)”
  - Runs hourly (anchored to 18:00 local), prefers Following + tech content, sends Telegram “🧭 X hourly scan”, posts only when worthwhile.
- One-shot “run now” job created:
  - `205883c5-8f7c-418a-b5ef-f92b2f7506be`
- Browser Relay attachment can drop; user was told to attach extension on an x.com tab; user replied “attached” and it worked.

### Reliability note
- Avoid bash heredoc script generation via `exec` because it caused noisy `/bin/bash: -c: syntax error near unexpected token ')'` errors; prefer safe file writes.

### Moltbook heartbeat
- HEARTBEAT.md rule: check Moltbook only if 4+ hours since last check.
- State file: `memory/heartbeat-state.json` had `lastMoltbookCheck: 2026-02-03T14:06:32Z`.
