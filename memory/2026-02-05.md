- User asked to stop Moltbook and keep it off for now; paused future checks and noted it in HEARTBEAT.md.
- User wants the trading job that used to run 4 times/day every 4 hours to be adjusted to run 3 times/day (every 3 hours) between 09:00 and 17:00; will need the exact command/script to launch before I can fire it up.
- Confirmed the current official plan is for BTC, entry 73,180 USD, stop ~71,800 USD, target 74,500 USD, paper mode; exit logic allows trailing above new highs or locking in early on a stall, plus I’ll log P&L when you settle with `trading-support settle <trade_id> --exit-price 74500`. Need specific command to schedule three-times-a-day execution within 08:00–17:00, and once provided I’ll create the cron job and start it.
- Created `/home/cechinel/.openclaw/workspace/run_coinbase_plan.sh`, piped `y` into `trading-support plan ... --paper` with the BTC plan details, and executed it once manually. The ledger recorded trade ID `2620d4f6-99e2-4107-bd5c-a9425c7140e2`, the Telegram brief sent out, and the plan remained in paper mode. Also added a cron job (`a8af950c-d732-462b-a7ea-d4fe40ec552a`) that will run that script at 08:00, 11:00, and 14:00 Europe/London every day.
